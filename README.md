# TheaBest's Creeperkin and PufferFish Origins - Reborn!

All of the pufferfish code and some of the creeper code has been blatently stolen from Theabest#3667 in the official Origins Discord Server. This datapack aims to add flexibility by splitting the Creeperkin and Pufferfish origin up, and to make it so that the Creeperkin origin doesn't suck. There is some unused code in the Creeperkin datapack that I'm just leaving because I barely know what I'm doing. If you want to add back in the coloration of the player, be my guest, it's not my code. You can just add that thing back into the main creeper.json file, and happy days!

Blah blah installation goes in your world folder blah blah if you're here you probably know how to do it anywys so I won't spare you the details, the thing you do need to note however is that the individual zip files are on the releases page, so make sure to go there to get them here:

If the original mod author wants me to take this down, please contact me via some means and I shall promptly remove this from the public eye. Better to ask for forgiveness than permission amiright?

I'm being very sarcastic here, just FYI.
