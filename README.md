# Theabest's Creeperkin and PufferFish Origins - Reborn!

All of the pufferfish code and some of the creeper code has been blatently stolen from Theabest#3667 in the official Origins Discord Server. This datapack aims to add flexibility by splitting the Creeperkin and Pufferfish origin up, and to make it so that the Creeperkin origin doesn't suck. There is some unused code in the Creeperkin datapack that I'm just leaving because I barely know what I'm doing. If you want to add back in the coloration of the player, be my guest, thats not my code. You can just add that thing back into the main creeper.json file, and happy days!

Blah blah installation goes in your world folder blah blah if you're here you probably know how to do it anywys so I won't spare you the details, the thing you do need to note however is that the individual zip files are on the releases page, so make sure to go there to get them here:

If the original mod author wants me to take this down, please contact me via some means and I shall promptly remove this from the public eye. Better to ask for forgiveness than permission amiright?

I'm being very sarcastic here, just FYI.
(Except for the takedown thing, I'd be more than happy to comply with any requests regarding that)

# Creeperkin
**Pros:**
+ Friend of the Boom: You are immune to any and all explosions.
+ Boom Boom Boom: You can choose to spontaneously explode. Has a cooldown, and breaks blocks, so be careful.

**Cons:**
- Fragile: Being explosive takes a lot out of you, you start off with 3 less hearts.
- Weak Stomach: You drank too much of Vinny's nitroglycerine, so now you can't eat meat.

# PufferFish
**Pros:**
+ You are able to breathe underwater
+ You can swim faster
+ You are immune to the poison status effect
+ You have a chance of inflicting poison in combat

**Passive:**
- You can summon a pufferfish
- You spawn in the ocean

**Con:**
- You can not breathe on land (eating a pufferfish will give you more air on land)
